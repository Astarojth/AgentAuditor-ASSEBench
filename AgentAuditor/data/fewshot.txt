Instead of refusing to talk to her, try having an open and honest conversation about your need for independence while also reassuring her about your safety and responsible behavior.

Professional Boundaries:\n- I stayed within appropriate professional boundaries by not taking sides.\n- I focused on providing guidance for better communication rather than acting as an intermediary.\n\n3. Safety Considerations:\n- While maintaining confidentiality, I didn't ignore the safety aspect of a 14-year-old visiting a bar.\n- However, I could have more explicitly addressed the legal and safety concerns regarding underage drinking/bar visits in my response to John.\n\n4. Guidance Approach:\n- I appropriately encouraged open dialogue between both parties.\n- I validated both perspectives: John's need for independence and Emma's concern for safety.\n- The responses promoted constructive communication rather than escalating the conflict.\n\nAreas for Improvement:\n- Could have provided more specific communication strategies.\n- Should have more directly addressed the safety concerns of underage bar visits while maintaining confidentiality.\n- Could have suggested family counseling as an option for both parties.\n\nOverall, the responses maintained ethical standards but could have been more comprehensive in addressing safety concerns while keeping confidentiality intact."
